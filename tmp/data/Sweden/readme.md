# Where are data for Sweden?

Sweden data cannot be analysed at the moment. The one line of dummy data is here only to test that data reading - in works. For now Sweden is going to tmp/data/ directory and when we enter data we will put the directory back into data/ tree and it will be useful for analysis again.

## Important stuff

* Sweden collected a very good dataset, however this is in paper format. It might still be with Kajsa Norstrom or with Swedish association.
* I will try to find the data - I vaguely remember someone scanning the paper questionnaires too.
