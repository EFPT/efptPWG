## EFPT Psychotherapy Working Group Survey 2011 - 2016

This is project to conduct and analyse data from EFPT survey. It has been going on for quite long, thus illustrating the estimate for international voluntary projects described by Khaneman in "Thinking Fast and Thinking Slow". However it looks like we are moving somewhere interesting with it now.

Data have been collected from 20 countries so far.
