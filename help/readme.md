# Explanations are kept here

Well, mostly here. In fact they are also in tmp/ directory. For example when experimenting with code I comment it more extensively than necessary in **snippets** files  so that after some time I could remember in more detail, if needed. This many comments really should not go into the main code as they would reduce readability, I think. Hence for brief to the paoint  explanations we look in the main code in the bin/ directory. More explanations, created as we experiemnt with the code interactively, are found in tmp/snippets. Some other helpful notes could go in this directory here.

## What is the *.ncd file

Some years ago I bought a licence for structured/hierarchical notes program Notecase Pro by Miloslav Rajcic (http://notecasepro.com). I find it quite useful sometimes. It also allows to create strongly encrypted notes (e.g. for patients) and it is portable and it works on all the platforms - Mac and Windows too. It can be used as freeware; the limitations are not particularly strict. You can read a Mac user's experience with this [here at friendlyskies](http://www.friendlyskies.net/notebook/notecase-pro-review-cross-platform-hierarchical-note-taking) 

## What goes into the *.Rmd report

Well, we would put our main report there. Perhaps commenting is good, but when we are writing the main report - we are really writing it as a bit of an article. So all 'eureka' moments comments and discoveries about the joys of programming probably should not go there.
