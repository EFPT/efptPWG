# Explanations are kept here

Well, mostly here. In fact they are also in tmp/ directory. For example when experimenting with code I comment it more extensively than necessary in **snippets** files  so that after some time I could remember in more detail, if needed. So many comments really should not go into the main code, I think. So for brief explanations - look in the main code in the bin/ directory. More in tmp/snippets and still various other things in here.

## What is the *.ncd file

Some years ago I bought a licence for structured notes program Notecase Pro by Milosval Rajcic. I find it quite useful as it allows also to creat strongly encrypted notes (e.g. for patients) and it is portable and it works on all the platforms - Mac and Windows included. It can be used as freeware too, the limitations are not particularly strict. 

## What goes into the *.Rmd 

Well, we would put our main report there. Perhaps commenting is good, but when we are writing the main report - we are really writing it as a bit of an article. So all 'eureka' moments comments and discoveries about the joys of programming probably should not go there.
