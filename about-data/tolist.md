# To do list

* merge all the data : analysis in the whole europe (TG)
** number of trainee in each country (TG)
 principle - list directories read that list into a vector then for each element of the vectior (i.e. country name) and all the syntax files for that reason also start with the country name so if country name is a variable we simply subsititute that variable into the script when we loop over the list (i.e. the vector) containing names of durectories

* write about the context of the study : Michael Areska, Rita, Roberts, Alina (RK)

* Europe map

* Ask help for statistical inference ? MOOC

* NB : change labels in the analysis file not in syntax file
