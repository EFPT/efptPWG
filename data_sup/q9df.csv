My experienced outcome is more productive psychiatric work in terms of the clients well-being.     An important part of applying psychotherapeutic skills is also to see their limitations and how they can be applied appropriately. This requires training in the subject. Also, writing statements as a psychiatrist to patients for them to get financial support from the society for psychotherapy requires understanding of psychotherapy from the psychotherapist. Increasingly psychiatrists in Finland are expected to be able to recommend a certain modality of therapy to their patints when writing these statements.

Il s'agit aussi d'une demande des patients et se contenter d'entretiens non structurés peut les amener à penser qu'ils sont responsables du peut d'amélioration de leur état, entretenant ainsi le processus pathologique. Actuellement je trouve que la formation aux psychothérapies est totalement aléatoire en France et non valorisée dans le cursus de base (particulièrement dans la subdivision de Brest où je suis en formation), les facultés de proposant quasiment que des ""initiations"" dont la qualité est souvent pauvre. Il reste que l'obtention du doctorat de médecine et la validation du DES (diplôme d'études spécialisé) de psychiatrie ne nécessite aucunement que l'on se forme à quelque thérapie que ce soit, permettant (et entretenant!) le fait que l'on puisse être qualifié de thérapeute sans avoir était à aucun moment formé à cela !!!"
