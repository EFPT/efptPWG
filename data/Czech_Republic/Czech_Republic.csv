In our country psychiatric and psychotherapy training are separate things - the training in PT is not a mandatory part of training in psychiatry and is not supported very much, although some psychiatric institutionns support psychiatres and psychologues by paying for their PT training. In my psychiatry training mandatory was only a course of theoretical lectures about psychotherapy, about 20-30 hours, the PT traning was my own initiative. The conditions of Psychiatry training are chaging though, so maybe it´s different now for psychiatrists in training."
