Anyhow- if you have some issues you can go and see a psychiatrist who will inevitably prescribe you drugs. If you don\'t want them there is little else that they will do. Perhaps you will get an appointment or two, but only 20 minutes once a month. You could pay for you own therapy (which cost anything from 20 to 100 euros per hour) but you don\'t really have a reliable source of information who is qualified and who isn\'t.
Hope this helps. Thank you for taking the time and investing the energy into such an important matter. I support you efforts and will be glad to help in the future!

Based on my own interest I started reading about psychotherapy, searchiong information and eventually started training in psychotherapy, which was completely up to me and I had to find all the informations abour different modalities myself. Also I did not have a possibility to practice psychotherapy during working hours, as other work responsibilities were the priority. So far, although already a specialist in psychiatry, I have only managed to finish first levels in two modalities and do not have time to start practicing with patients on a regular basis, as there is a shortage of physicians.
Another problem is more of a systemic nature - there are several formal and informal training programmes available, provided by different institutions, but there is now country-based criteria about what every trainig should consist of. Most institutions, that provide trainig in psychotherapy don\'t guarantee a state-recognised diploma and only few of them provide the title \""psychotherapist\"". For the past 10-15 years the government has been preparing an act about psychotherapy, the purpose of which would be to regulate and unify the criteria for trainig in psychotherapy and gainig the title. So far, nothing has happened, the consequence being, that there are many therapists of different modalities and training (and of different basic professions), but there is not a state-official institution regulating them."
