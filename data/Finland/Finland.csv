I've aexperienced often taht therapeutic communication supports the psychiatric rehabilitation process, supports the effect of medication the psychiatrist prescribes, alleviates suffering that can be treated without medicine, enhances the doctor-patient alliance and motivates the client to invest themselves in the rehabilitation process. My experienced outcome is more productive psychiatric work in terms of the clients well-being. 

An important part of applying psychotherapeutic skills is also to see their limitations and how they can be applied appropriately. This requires training in the subject. Also, writing statements as a psychiatrist to patients for them to get financial support from the society for psychotherapy requires understanding of psychotherapy from the psychotherapist. Increasingly psychiatrists in Finland are expected to be able to recommend a certain modality of therapy to their patints when writing these statements. This kind of recommendations require understanding, and hence training, in a wide range of psychotherapeutic modalities.","Yes","No","No","No","No","","Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dialectic Behavioural Therapy, Trauma Therapy","2","4","3","0","0","","State / 3rd party pays","State / 3rd party pays","I pay","I don't have it","State / 3rd party pays","I pay","Yes","5","Disagree","Disagree","Disagree","","Yes","No","Yes","No","No","No","Yes","Yes","No","","Uncertain","Yes","Uncertain","Uncertain","Uncertain","Yes","Yes","Uncertain",""

Many psychotherapists that practice in the private sector have sought and been given proof of fullfilling certain specified requirements for their patients to be entitled to a certain degree of (partial) public funding for up to 2 or 3 years therapy. The funding is granted through a process of annual applications that has to be supported by an evaluation conducted by a psychiatrists and a statement by the psychiatrist and the psychotherapist. The application has to go through a formal approval process conducted by the national funding body. Some patients may receive funding for psychothreapy through their private insurance (less common) and again some may have the opportunity to chose to pay for themselves. Younger children may also be granted funding for therapy through the hospital/health services (that have public funded through tax money).","0","0","0","0","0","","I don't have it","I don't have it","I don't have it","I don't have it","I don't have it","I don't have it","Yes","0","Strongly Disagree","Agree","Strongly Disagree","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","We have been told that the (UEMS) requirements are that those in training should at least receive general theoretical information on various forms of psychoterapy and the application of psychotherapy as part of the care and treatment of patients with psychiatric illhealth / conditions.
