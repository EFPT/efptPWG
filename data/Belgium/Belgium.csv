feel this is a crucial part of our training- I have not embarked upon such a training yet in Belgium.
The reasons for this are twofold 1. The generally (very) poor quality of the offered training yet
ridiculously overpriced cost in Belgium (only sustainable because of very,very limited choice/monopoly of certain 
organisations) and 2. The semi-coerced choice in what stream you as a trainee would like to train in,the result
of agreements between the academic (psychiatry department) and non-academic (commercial
organisation offering ""training"" of one circumscribed kind).

However, I am currently doing a phd in the UK and looked into getting a training here (I honestly feel
the need to) and was relieved to find decent programmes being offered- although the cost is considerable,
Yet at least,I would be paying for a solid,decent training at a recognised institute in the stream of my choice."

In general a psychiatrist should work in collaboration with other team members who posses psychotherapeutical skills and should be able to refer to them.
